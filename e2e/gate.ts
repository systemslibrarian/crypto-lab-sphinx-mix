/**
 * Shared machinery for the WCAG gate.
 *
 * Five rules govern everything here, and each one corrects something the gate
 * this replaces did:
 *
 *  1. NOTHING IS INJECTED INTO THE PAGE BEFORE A SCAN. The old spec pushed
 *     `animation:none!important; transition:none!important` through
 *     `addStyleTag`. That BYPASSES this lab's own
 *     `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block instead of exercising it,
 *     so the one rendering a reduced-motion reader actually gets — `.reveal`
 *     with its animation cancelled by the stylesheet's own rule — was never
 *     once the rendering that got scanned. This gate sets the
 *     preference through `emulateMedia`, asserts from inside the page that it
 *     took effect (`test.use({ reducedMotion })` silently does nothing on
 *     Playwright 1.61.1), and injects nothing.
 *
 *  2. IT FORCED EVERY PANEL VISIBLE FROM SCRIPT. The old drive stripped every
 *     `[hidden]` attribute and set every `<details>.open` by JS before its only
 *     scan. Stripping `hidden` puts all six act panels on screen AT ONCE — a
 *     rendering no reader can reach and axe then scans instead of the real one
 *     — and script-opening the disclosures means the SHUT state, which is what
 *     every reader arrives at, was never scanned at all. This gate switches
 *     tabs by clicking them and opens each disclosure through its `<summary>`,
 *     which is the route a reader has, and scans before and after.
 *
 *  3. IT DROVE BLIND AND THEN THREW THE STATES AWAY. The old drive clicked
 *     every button whose label matched a regex, swallowed every failure with
 *     `.catch(() => {})`, waited a fixed 120ms per tab, and scanned ONCE at the
 *     end — so the dead-hop rendering, the REPLAY_DETECTED branch, the
 *     corrupted-payload panel and the builder's intermediate reveals were all
 *     overwritten before anything measured them, and a click that silently did
 *     nothing looked identical to one that worked. This drive names every
 *     control it touches, asserts a real completion signal after each, and
 *     scans after every step, at 1280 and at 380.
 *
 *  4. `violations` IS NOT THE WHOLE ORACLE. See `scan`. The surfaces that carry
 *     this lab's meaning — all four `.verdict-*` tones, all three `.pill`
 *     states, the `.callout-scope` and `.callout-neg` panels, the three
 *     `.hopnode` states and the shared top bar's `color-mix()` ink — are all
 *     `color-mix()` fills axe files under `incomplete` rather than judging. So
 *     is an `aria-label` on a role-less element.
 *
 *  5. IT HAD NO REFLOW, NON-TEXT-CONTRAST OR GENERATED-CONTENT ORACLE. The old
 *     spec hand-rolled one luminance check over two input selectors, reading
 *     the DECLARED `border-top-color` and `background-color` — blind to
 *     `color-mix()`, to composited backdrops, to every `.btn`, `.tab-btn`,
 *     `.check-opt`, `.hopnode` and `.pill`, and to all states past first paint.
 *     `nontext.ts` replaces it with a measured oracle over every control at
 *     every driven state, and `expectNoHorizontalOverflow` adds the 1.4.10
 *     check axe has no rule for.
 */

/**
 * Wait for every running animation and transition to drain.
 *
 * Two rAFs are not enough. A transition sampled mid-flight has a colour that
 * exists in no state of the page, and axe will happily report it: elsewhere in
 * this fleet that produced a phantom 2.00:1 failure on a button whose settled
 * ratio is 9:1. Transitions also drain in waves rather than in one batch, so a
 * poll for "nothing running right now" can exit through a gap between waves —
 * hence six consecutive quiet frames rather than one.
 *
 * Bounded three ways, because a gate that can hang is a gate nobody runs:
 * animations that never finish (`iterations: Infinity`) are excluded from the
 * quiescence test rather than waited on, a wall-clock budget inside the page
 * gives up and proceeds, and Playwright's own timeout is the backstop.
 *
 * Under the reduced motion this gate asserts, `style.css`'s reduced-motion
 * block cancels the `.reveal` animation and every transition, so
 * `getAnimations()` is normally empty and this returns on the sixth frame. It
 * stays because the shared top bar's `.cl-btn` transitions are declared
 * OUTSIDE the lab's `@media` block — `* { transition: none !important }` wins
 * today, but that is a property of the current stylesheet, not of the page.

 *    best-practice rules `withTags` does not run on its own.
 *  - `incomplete` — axe's "could not decide" bucket, which never reaches the
 *    violations array. The one rule id allowed to remain incomplete is
 *    `color-contrast`, and only because the next assertion computes those
 *    ratios arithmetically — which matters here because the surfaces carrying
 *    this lab's meaning are `color-mix()` fills axe cannot resolve: all four
 *    verdict tones, all three pill states, the scope and negative-claim
 *    callouts, the three hopnode states, `.btn-danger`, the hero aside and the
 *    shared bar's ink. Everything else in that bucket is a real result axe
 *    simply could not finish — including `aria-prohibited-attr`, which is
 *    where an `aria-label` on a role-less element hides. This page leans on
 *    getting that right: the byte histogram, the routing-block composition bar
 *    and the entropy meter are `role="img"` elements whose `aria-label`
 *    carries the numbers a sighted reader takes off the bars, and both
 *    `.table-wrap` scrollers are `role="region"` with a label. Drop any of
 *    those roles and the label is silently discarded.
 *  - arithmetic contrast — composite-aware WCAG 1.4.3 over every text node.
 *  - the same walk over `aria-hidden` content with the exemption lifted —
 *    SC 1.4.3 is about what a reader SEES; see `contrast.ts` for what this
 *    lab hides and why it is measured anyway.
 *  - non-text contrast and generated content — SC 1.4.11, ratcheted; see
 *    `expectNoNewNonTextFailures`. This is the only oracle that judges a
 *    control's boundary against the surface OUTSIDE it.
 *  - keyboard reachability of scrolling regions — WCAG 2.1.1.
 *  - no focusable element that paints nothing — WCAG 2.4.3/2.4.7.
 *  - reflow — WCAG 1.4.10, which axe has no rule for at all.

/**
 * Drive the lab through the states that render content, scanning each.

 * Five things shape this drive:
 *
 *  - THE ARRIVAL STATE IS SCANNED FIRST, exactly as a reader gets it: act 1
 *    active with its stepper at zero, five acts hidden and unrendered, every
 *    disclosure shut. The retired template gate force-revealed all of it
 *    before its only scan.
 *
 *  - EVERY ACT IS RENDERED LAZILY, so a tab that is never clicked is a panel
 *    that is never even IN the DOM. Each of the six is activated through its
 *    real tab button and scanned in its own driven states.
 *
 *  - EVERY FAILURE STATE. A packet that dies at a hop repaints that hop
 *    `.hopnode-dead` and prints a `.pill-bad` failure code; the second
 *    transmission of the same packet takes the REPLAY_DETECTED branch; the
 *    tagging act renders a corrupted-payload verdict beside an all-green one.
 *    None of these is reachable without breaking something on purpose, and on
 *    this fleet none of them had ever been scanned.
 *
 *  - HOVER IS A STATE, AND IT PERSISTS AFTER A CLICK. `:hover` stays on the
 *    element under the pointer after `page.click()` resolves, so it is the
 *    state a reader occupies the instant after pressing a button -- and
 *    `.tab-btn:hover`, `.btn:hover`, `.check-opt:hover` and `.cl-btn:hover`
 *    all repaint their fill or their border. Each is scanned explicitly.
 *
 *  - NO FIXED TIMEOUTS. Every wait is on a real DOM completion signal: a
 *    verdict appearing, a step counter, a failure pill, `aria-selected`, the
 *    entropy meter that act 6 only paints once its real packets are built.
